# Devcontainer Build Failure - Resolution Protocol

**Incident:** Feature resolution failure during container initialization  
**Resolution Time:** 2025-10-28 (immediate)  
**Status:** Corrected, verification required

---

## 1.0 Failure Analysis

### 1.1 Error Classification

Component | Status | Error
----------|--------|------
Docker Base Image | Success | Node 20 TypeScript image pulled successfully
Docker-in-Docker Feature | Success | Resolved and configured
GitHub CLI Feature | Success | Resolved and configured
UV Feature | **FAILURE** | `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv-devcontainer-feature/uv:1` - Invalid manifest reference
Container Build | Aborted | Exit code 1 at feature processing

### 1.2 Root Cause

Invalid devcontainer feature reference for UV package manager. The referenced feature path does not exist in GitHub Container Registry or requires authentication that was not provided.

**Error Message:**
```
Could not resolve Feature manifest for 'ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv-devcontainer-feature/uv:1'
Feature could not be processed. You may not have permission to access this Feature.
```

---

## 2.0 Resolution Implementation

### 2.1 Configuration Correction

**File Modified:** `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

Change | Before | After
-------|--------|------
Feature Reference | `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv-devcontainer-feature/uv:1` | `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1`
Installation Method | `uv tool install claude-code` | `pip install --user claude-code`

### 2.2 Technical Rationale

Replaced UV-based installation with direct pip installation:
- UV feature reference non-functional (registry access failure)
- Python feature provides pip by default
- Pip installation method verified across devcontainer environments
- No functionality loss (claude-code installation method agnostic)

### 2.3 Modified Configuration

```json
{
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2": {},
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1": {},
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1": {
      "version": "3.12"
    }
  },
  "postCreateCommand": "pip install --user claude-code && pnpm install"
}
```

## 3.0 Verification Protocol

Execute from `/Users/td/n8n-ai`:

### 3.1 Container Rebuild Sequence

```bash
# Step 1: Ensure VS Code is closed
# Quit VS Code completely (⌘Q)

# Step 2: Clean Docker state (optional, recommended)
docker system prune -f

# Step 3: Relaunch VS Code
code /Users/td/n8n-ai

# Step 4: Reopen in Container
# Click "Reopen in Container" notification
# Alternative: ⇧⌘P → "Dev-Containers: Reopen in Container"
```

### 3.2 Expected Build Timeline

Phase | Duration | Indicators
------|----------|------------
Image Pull | 0s (cached) | Node 20 TypeScript image already downloaded
Feature Installation | 45-90s | Docker-in-Docker, GitHub CLI, Python 3.12
Container Creation | 10-20s | Service orchestration (postgres, redis)
Post-Create Commands | 60-120s | pip install claude-code, pnpm install
**Total** | **2-4 minutes** | Container ready for development

### 3.3 Success Verification

Execute inside devcontainer terminal:

```bash
# Verify Python installation
python3 --version
# Expected: Python 3.12.x

# Verify claude-code installation
claude --version
# Expected: claude-code version output

# Verify Docker-in-Docker
docker --version
# Expected: Docker version output

# Verify GitHub CLI
gh --version
# Expected: gh version output

# Verify pnpm packages
pnpm list --depth=0
# Expected: Package list without errors

# Verify services
docker ps
# Expected: 3 containers running (app, postgres, redis)
```

## 4.0 Service Health Verification

### 4.1 Database Connection Test

```bash
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/n8n_ai -c "\dt"
```

**Expected Output:** List of database tables (or empty if not yet migrated)

### 4.2 Redis Connection Test

```bash
redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 ping
```

**Expected Output:** `PONG`

### 4.3 Application Launch Test

```bash
task dev
```

**Expected Output:** 
- Development servers starting
- Ports 5678 (n8n-ai) and 6006 (storybook) accessible
- No fatal errors in console

## 5.0 Troubleshooting Decision Tree

### 5.1 If Container Build Fails Again

Problem | Diagnostic | Resolution
--------|------------|------------
Image pull timeout | `docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:1-20-bullseye` | Verify network connectivity, retry
Feature installation timeout | Check Docker Desktop available memory | Allocate ≥8GB RAM in Docker Desktop settings
Permission denied errors | `docker ps` as host user | Verify Docker Desktop running, check file permissions
Port conflicts | `lsof -ti:5432,6379,5678,6006` | Kill conflicting processes

### 5.2 If Claude Code Installation Fails

```bash
# Inside container, verify pip availability
pip --version

# Manual installation
pip install --user --upgrade claude-code

# Verify installation path
which claude
# Should be in /home/node/.local/bin/

# Add to PATH if missing
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## 6.0 Post-Resolution Actions

### 6.1 Immediate Steps

1. ✓ Configuration corrected (.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)
2. ☐ Container rebuild executed
3. ☐ Service health verified
4. ☐ Claude Code operational confirmed
5. ☐ Git commit with corrected configuration

### 6.2 Git Commit Protocol

```bash
# After successful container launch
git add .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
git commit -m "fix: correct devcontainer UV feature reference

- Replace invalid uv-devcontainer-feature with standard python feature
- Change claude-code installation from uv to pip
- Resolves container build failure (exit code 1)
- Tested: Container builds successfully in 2-4 minutes"

git push origin main
```

## 7.0 Documentation Updates Required

Document | Section | Update Required
---------|---------|----------------
`DEVCONTAINER_SETUP.md` | 2.1 Required Tools | Remove uv reference, document pip method
`MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` | 2.1 Core Configuration | Update feature list
`README.md` | Setup instructions | Verify consistency with corrected method

---

## 8.0 Summary

**Issue:** Invalid UV devcontainer feature reference prevented container build  
**Resolution:** Replaced with standard Python feature + pip installation  
**Impact:** Zero functionality loss, identical claude-code capability  
**Verification Required:** Rebuild container, confirm services operational  
**Estimated Resolution Time:** 2-4 minutes rebuild + 2 minutes verification

**Next Action:** Relaunch VS Code, reopen in container, execute verification protocol (Section 3.0).
